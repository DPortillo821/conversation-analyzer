I have few questions. 
1. Why do I have to apology her? 
2. I heard that she was in the hopital. I've sent a lots of messages to her, but I didn't get any messages from her. Do you think it is polite? I don't understand her.
3. Is there any reasonable reason for her to ignore all my messages? I need some reasonable reasons to understand her behavior. 
4. She said that she was very sick and couldn't do anything. But Suzy told me that she wasn't in the hospital. But I couldn't see her in the school. Also, I went her house to see if she is okay, but I couldn't meet her. There is no one in her home. I checked her medical record in "»ï¼º" hospital and her name was not in there. The most terrible thing is, especially, all things that she talked to me was a lie. I'm very upset. Do you think I'm too sensitive about this issue? 
5. Anyway, another issue. Today is the last day of the school so I have a long vacation. The next semester will be started on            03 September 2018 at 9:00 AM, with Lucy: Do you want to join us?
